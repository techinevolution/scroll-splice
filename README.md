# ScrollSplice

ScrollSplice is a scroll-native vertical comic editor. Its defining workspace combines a large editing viewport, a full-episode minimap, a synchronized layers list, and direct manipulation of comic elements.

This repository is the public Build Week record for ScrollSplice: <https://github.com/techinevolution/scroll-splice>.

**Name screen:** ScrollSplice replaced the conflicted ScrollForge working name on July 13. A basic exact-name screen found no matching software brand in general web search, GitHub repositories, npm, or PyPI. This is practical risk reduction, not legal trademark clearance; see [Build Week Compliance](BUILD_WEEK_COMPLIANCE.md#name-screen-and-clearance).

## Status and Build Week provenance

Katherine identified the seven original planning documents as work completed on July 12, 2026, before the Build Week submission period opened. They were first committed unchanged on July 13 at 11:28:56 AM PT as root commit `e4db897`, then marked by the annotated tag `pre-build-week-planning`. That baseline contains seven Markdown planning files and no application code. The Git timestamp proves when the snapshot was preserved; the separate timestamped July 12 Codex-session evidence is recorded in [Build Week Compliance](BUILD_WEEK_COMPLIANCE.md#3-pre-existing-work-boundary).

All judged implementation work will be committed after the July 13, 2026 9:00 AM PT submission-period start. Do not amend, squash, or rewrite the baseline commit or tag. See [Build Week Compliance](BUILD_WEEK_COMPLIANCE.md) for the evidence and final submission checklist.

Post-start documentation/compliance work is recorded separately in commit `a567865` at 11:50:26 AM PT on July 13. It adds the rules checklist, scope corrections, WEBTOON discovery, license, and privacy ignores, but still contains no application code.

Implementation began later on July 13 under a narrow approval that does not cover the full July 14 interaction slice. The locked application scaffold, framework-independent episode model, and original six-beat **Signal in the Fog** fixture now exist. The fixture contains 30 named layers made entirely from code-defined shapes and text; no private comic art is included. The editor shell, Konva viewport, minimap, layers UI, navigation, selection, movement, and reset are not built yet.

## Product sequence

### Build Week MVP — due July 21

The contest submission is the smallest complete, coherent ScrollSplice editor experience:

- one original vertical-comic fixture rendered from code-defined shapes and text
- a viewport-sized editing canvas
- a synchronized full-episode minimap
- a layers list synchronized with canvas selection
- one meaningful edit: move the selected element, plus reset
- public judge access and the required submission evidence

Import, persistence, undo, resize, ordering, production export, accounts, OAuth, OpenAI model access, autonomous generation, and direct publishing are deliberately outside the required milestone. If the human editor and every submission dependency are already stable, a narrowly bounded OpenAI image-generation proof may be attempted as stretch work; the submitted editor must not depend on it.

### Creator-ready MVP — after Build Week

The longer product milestone adds local asset import, saving and reopening, safe undo, ordering, reader preview, and a validated export pipeline. WEBTOON requirements are discovery inputs for that future exporter, not a reason to enlarge the one-week MVP.

### Autonomous creation — after the human workflow

The intended product later adds an OpenAI-powered creation mode that can understand a story brief, inspect a safe normalized view of the current project and episode layout, generate or edit comic images, add them to the asset library, and place them on the scroll through the same document commands used by a human.

This is a real product direction, not a Build Week requirement. The manual editor remains fully usable with AI turned off. A future model connection, editor tools, skills/instruction packs, generated-asset provenance, cost controls, and approval boundaries are described in [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md#future-openai-creation-boundary).

## Locked stack

- Node.js 22 and pnpm 10
- React 19 with strict TypeScript and Vite 8
- React-Konva/Konva for the viewport-sized interactive canvas
- Zustand for shared document and editor state
- Plain CSS for the application shell and panels
- Vitest, Playwright, ESLint, and `tsc --noEmit` for validation

The command contracts were verified on July 13 against the initial scaffold:

```bash
corepack pnpm install
corepack pnpm dev
corepack pnpm test
corepack pnpm typecheck
corepack pnpm lint
corepack pnpm build
corepack pnpm test:e2e
```

## Run the foundation scaffold

```bash
corepack pnpm install
corepack pnpm dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. The current page is a foundation status view, not the editor MVP.

Run the available validation with:

```bash
corepack pnpm test
corepack pnpm typecheck
corepack pnpm lint
corepack pnpm build
corepack pnpm test:e2e
```

## Build Week and model-use record

ScrollSplice is planned for the **Apps for Your Life** category. Codex with GPT-5.6 is the implementation collaborator; the local Codex configuration was verified as GPT-5.6 before implementation began. Dated commits will show where Codex accelerated architecture, implementation, testing, and review. The README must be updated with concrete examples from the finished work rather than invented retrospective claims.

OpenAI-powered image creation is an optional product stretch only after the human-operated editor, validation, public access, and submission evidence are secure. If it is not built during Build Week, the submission remains the human editor. If a proof is built, it must use synthetic inputs, preserve unrestricted judge access to the base editor, and be described only to the extent actually demonstrated.

The final submission also requires the Codex Session ID produced by `/feedback` from the primary task that implements ScrollSplice's core functionality. That ID does not exist yet and must be recorded here and in the submission checklist when generated.

## WEBTOON compatibility

Publishing to WEBTOON is manual through its website. ScrollSplice will not automate WEBTOON login, upload, or publishing. Current confirmed requirements, older/provisional episode limits, and the required authenticated discovery test are tracked in [WEBTOON Requirements](WEBTOON_REQUIREMENTS.md).

The Build Week MVP does not claim production-ready WEBTOON export. A future exporter will produce a tall master plus validated, ordered platform slices and will report dimension, file-size, and count problems before export.
